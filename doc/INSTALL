Gob Online Chat - Installation Instructions
---------------

Version: 0.4 (alpha)
Author: Ken Barber (ken@bob.sh)


1. System Requirements

The following platforms have been tested.

Intel IA32:

RedHat Linux 7.3, 8.0
Windows 2000, XP

Sparc4u:

Solaris 8, 9

For all platforms, you will need the following packages:

* Sun Java JRE 1.4.2 or greater (available from java.sun.com)


2. Installation
2.1 Linux


Step 1:

Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

    http://www.java.com/

Follow the instructions provided.


Step 2:

Download the Gob RPM from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gob/.

Once you have obtained the Gob RPM, you can install it:

    rpm -Uvh gobchat-0.4-1.rpm


Step 3:

Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server hostname.


Step 4: 

Start the application using the system V script:

    /etc/init.d/gob start


Step 5:

Setup your OS to start Gob when the system starts. Its best to use a provided 
utility for this, on RedHat the utility:

    /usr/sbin/ntsysv

Can be used.


Step 6:

Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
you should be able to connect to the server.


2.2 Unix (and like flavours)

Step 1:

Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

    http://www.java.com/

Follow the instructions provided.

Step 2:

Download the Gob tarball from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gob/.

Install the tarball into a safe place.

Step 3:

Place the contents of the 'website' directory somewhere in the servers
web server content area.

You will need to configure the web server to point to this directory.

Step 4:

Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server name.

Step 5:

The server application can be run like this:

    $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar server.jar

By default, the server dislays error messages on the console. This should 
probably be piped to a text file or some such.

I suggest creating an init script for this.

Step 6:

Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
you should be able to connect to the server.

2.3 Windows

Step 1:

Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

    http://www.java.com/

Follow the instructions provided.

Step 2:

Download the Gob ZIP file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gob/.

Install the tarball into a safe place.

Step 3:

Place the contents of the 'website' directory somewhere in the servers
web server content area. For IIS, this would probably be C:\InetPub\wwwroot.

You will need to configure the web server to point to this directory, if it 
isn't already.

Step 4:

Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server name.

Step 5:

Create a directory for the server component.

    mkdir C:\Program Files\Gob Online Chat

Step 6:

Copy the following directories from the unpacked ZIP file.

    xcopy config daemon doc log website "C:\Program Files\Gob Online Chat" /E /Q

Now the environment has been prepared.

Step 7:

Modify the file '%GobRoot%\config\gobd.conf.xml' to taste. Ensure the log file location
is valid and that all settings are correct, or else the daemon may not run.

Step 8:

Edit this script, and ensure the %GobRoot% variable is set correctly. Run the script.

%GobRoot%\daemon\InstallService

The service should have been installed. You can now start the service in 
the MMC for Services (Start -> All Programs -> Administrative Tools -> Services).

NOTE: The %GobRoot% variable in the InstallService batch file must be set 
without using spaces in the path. Use ~1 style notation instead. This is a bug
in JavaService, where it is not double quoting paths with spaces as it should.

For example, instead of:

set GobRoot="C:\Program Files\Gob Online Chat\"

Use:

set GobRoot="C:\progra~1\gobonl~1\"

Silly I know.

Step 9:

Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
you should be able to connect to the server.
