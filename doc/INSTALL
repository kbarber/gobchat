1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The following platforms have been tested.

Intel IA32:

- RedHat Linux 7.3, 8.0
- Windows 2000, XP

Sparc4u:

- Solaris 8, 9

For all platforms, you will need the following packages:

- Sun Java JRE 1.4.2 or greater (available from java.sun.com)


2. INSTALLATION

2.1 LINUX

  1. Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

     http://www.java.com/

     Follow the instructions provided.

  2. Download the Gob RPM from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gob/.

     Once you have obtained the Gob RPM, you can install it:

     rpm -Uvh gobchat-0.4-1.rpm

  3. Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server hostname.

  4. Start the application using the system V script:

     /etc/init.d/gob start

  5. Setup your OS to start Gob when the system starts. Its best to use a 
     provided utility for this, on RedHat the utility:

     /usr/sbin/ntsysv

     Can be used.

  6. Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
     you should be able to connect to the server.


2.2 UNIX

  1. Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

     http://www.java.com/

     Follow the instructions provided.

  2. Download the Gob tarball from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gob/.

     Install the tarball into a safe place.

  3. Place the contents of the 'website' directory somewhere in the servers
     web server content area.

     You will need to configure the web server to point to this directory.

  4. Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server name.

  5. The server application can be run like this:

     $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar server.jar

     By default, the server dislays error messages on the console. This should 
     probably be piped to a text file or some such.

     I suggest creating an init script for this.

  6. Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
     you should be able to connect to the server.

2.3 WINDOWS

  1. Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

     http://www.java.com/

     Follow the instructions provided.

  2. Download the Gob Online Chat windows installation file from:
 
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/gob/

     Run the application to install the software. Choose defaults.

  3. Ensure IIS is running, by checking the Services MMC application.

  4. Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server name. This file will
     probably be located:

     C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\gob\index.html

  5. Modify the file '%GobRoot%\config\gobd.conf.xml' to taste. Ensure the log file location
     is valid and that all settings are correct, or else the daemon may not run.

     Restart the Gob Online Chat Server service to enact the changes.

  6. Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
     you should be able to connect to the server.

     You can also use the shortcut provided:
