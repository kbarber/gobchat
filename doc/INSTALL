Version: 0.4 (alpha)

1. System Requirements

The following platforms have been tested.

Intel IA32:

RedHat Linux 7.3, 8.0
Windows 2000, XP

Sparc4u:

Solaris 8, 9

For all platforms, you will need the following packages:

* Sun Java JRE 1.4.2 or greater (available from java.sun.com)


2. Installation
2.1 Linux


Step 1:

Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

    http://www.java.com/

Follow the instructions provided.


Step 2:

Download the Gob RPM from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gob/.

Once you have obtained the Gob RPM, you can install it:

    rpm -Uvh gobchat-0.4-1.rpm


Step 3:

Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server hostname.


Step 4: 

Start the application using the system V script:

    /etc/init.d/gob start


Step 5:

Setup your OS to start Gob when the system starts. Its best to use a provided 
utility for this, on RedHat the utility:

    /usr/sbin/ntsysv

Can be used.


Step 6:

Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
you should be able to connect to the server.


2.2 Unix (and like flavours)

Step 1:

Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

    http://www.java.com/

Follow the instructions provided.

Step 2:

Download the Gob tarball from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gob/.

Install the tarball into a safe place.

Step 3:

Place the contents of the 'website' directory somewhere in the servers
web server content area.

You will need to configure the web server to point to this directory.

Step 4:

Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server name.

Step 5:

The server application can be run like this:

    $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar server.jar

By default, the server dislays error messages on the console. This should 
probably be piped to a text file or some such.

I suggest creating an init script for this.

Step 6:

Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
you should be able to connect to the server.

2.3 Windows
