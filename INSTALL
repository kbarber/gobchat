Instructions for installation

If you can obtain an RPM, install that.

rpm -Uvh gobchat-0.1-1.rpm

If your unfortunate enough to be running windows, sorry - this will work, by
I haven't built any nice wrapper scripts.

On the server you wish to install this program:

1. Download and install Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. It is available from:

http://java.sun.com/

2. The server application can be ran like this:

$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar server.jar

By default, the server dislays error messages on the console. This should 
probably be piped to a text for or some such.

3. Place the contents of the 'website' directory somewhere in the servers
web server content area.

4. Modify the HTML file index.html, and specify your server name.

5. Access the website using the proper hostname. The client should work, and
you should be able to connect to the server.


TROUBLESHOOTING

* Remember that you must install the server and client on the same system. As
these are not signed Applets, there is no support for connecting to alternate
servers other than the one which served the Applet.

* The client and server must use Java JRE 1.4.1 or greater. Ensure these versions
are correct on all systems concerned.
